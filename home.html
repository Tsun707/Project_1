     <h2>Balkans</h2>
     <p>The area is located in the south of Europe made up of 11 countries, about 550,000 km2  and 55,000,000 populations. 
     Due to the historical reasons, the place becomes an area where multiple cultures mix, and somehow unsteadiness.</p>

     <h3>Croatia</h3>
     <p>Croatia sought independence primarily due to ethnic tensions with the Serb minority, who were supported by the central Yugoslav government. 
     The desire for self-determination and a distinct national identity, exacerbated by economic disparities and historical grievances, prompted Croatia to declare independence on June 25, 1991..</p>
     
     <h3>Slovenia</h3>
     <p>Slovenia pursued independence because it had the most developed economy among Yugoslav republics and sought to escape the economic burdens of the Yugoslav federation.
	 Ethnic and cultural differences also played a role, leading to its declaration of independence on June 25, 1991, marking the start of the Yugoslav breakup.</p>
      
     <h3>Bosnia and Herzegovina</h3>
     <p>Bosnia's independence was driven by a complex mix of ethnic and religious divisions, with Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs vying for control.
	 The Bosnian War, triggered by the declaration of independence in March 1992, was a result of these deep-seated tensions, leading to Bosnia and Herzegovina's separation from Yugoslavia.</p>
      
     <h3>Serbia</h3>
     <p>Serbia's position during the breakup of Yugoslavia was complex.
	 While Serbia played a significant role in the Yugoslav federation and was seen by some as its successor, it also had aspirations to maintain a unified Yugoslav state, known as the "Greater Serbia" concept, which led to conflicts with other republics seeking independence.</p>
      
     <h3>Dilemma of Administration</h3>
     <p>Serbia's desire to retain political influence and a dominant role in the federation, along with historical, ethnic, and nationalist factors, contributed to its reluctance to let go of the Yugoslav union. 
	 This stance led to violent conflicts and wars, such as the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War, as other republics sought to break away from Serbian influence..</p>
	  
     <h3>The Ending of Yugoslavia</h3>
     <p>In the end, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and Montenegro) continued to exist until 2003 when it was reconstituted as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and finally dissolved in 2006, leading to Montenegro's independence.
	 Serbia itself became an independent country after the dissolution of the union.</p>
